We welcome new postdoctoral associate Kerri-Ann Anderson to the HeMI:IDI team. Anderson's past research utilized mathematical and computational models of cultural evolution to simulate the evolution of vaccine belief-behavior interactions. She is currently working to incorporate evolving health decision-making strategies into dynamical models of disease transmission and health-behavior adoption. Anderson holds a Master of Mathematical Sciences in Mathematical Biosciences from Ohio State University and a PhD in Biological Sciences (Cultural/Behavioral Evolution) from Vanderbilt University.
