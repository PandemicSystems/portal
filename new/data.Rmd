## Data Sources
CEID now maintains a public repository of datasets used in our COVID-19 projects. The datasets in the repository were compiled by members of the CEID COVID-19 working group. The data have been formated to be used 'as-is' and are updated often. Data sets were either created from html scraping or manually entered. In the case of the automated web scraping, the raw data and scripts are included. 


```{r,setup,echo=FALSE,include=TRUE,results="asis"}


# get a list of all the files in the folder
file_list <- list.files(path = "hey", full.names = TRUE)

# initialize a data frame to store the file information
df <- data.frame(filename = character(),
                 date_created = character(),
                 stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# loop through the files in the folder
for (file in file_list) {
  # get the file name
  file_name <- as.character(file)

  # get the date created
  date_created <- as.character(file.info(file)$ctime)

  # add the file information to the data frame
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(filename = file_name,
                             date_created = date_created,
                             stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
}

# data frame in decreasing order of date
df <- df[order(df$date_created,decreasing= TRUE),]
#displaying the latest
cat(htmltools::includeMarkdown(df[1,1]))
