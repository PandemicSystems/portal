## CEID \n

now maintains a public repository of datasets used in our COVID-19 projects. The datasets in the repository were compiled by members of the CEID COVID-19 working group. The data have been formated to be used 'as-is' and are updated often. Data sets were either created from html scraping or manually entered. In the case of the automated web scraping, the raw data and scripts are included.
