      Justin Bahl is an Associate Professor at the University of Georgia with appointments in the College of Public Health,       College of Veterinary Medicine, and Institute of Bioinformatics.  
      Having completed a B.S. with Honors at the University of Toronto, he pursued a PhD in Molecular Systematics and            Evolution at the University of Hong Kong.  With Hong Kong as the epicenter of the 2003 SARS-CoV global epidemic,           Justin changed his research focus to ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.
      <span class="read-more-target">
      After completing his PhD, he joined the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases as a postdoctoral            fellow and researched viral ecology and evolution.  The State Key Laboratory is a World Health Organization (WHO)          reference laboratory for the diagnosis of influenza A/H5 and is part of the NIAID Centers for Excellence for               Influenza Research and Surveillance.  He later moved to Singapore to continue his postdoctoral training in Molecular       Epidemiology at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School and was promoted to Assistant Professor. He later joined the              University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston as an Associate Professor before relocating to the University       of Georgia. 
      His training in evolutionary biology, epidemiology and ecology has equipped him for a research career focused on           infectious disease dynamics.

  <p>
      John Drake is Regents Professor of Ecology, Odum School of Ecology and Director of the Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) and the Global Infectious Disease Intelligence Consortium (GIDIC), University of Georgia. 
A biological modeler who studies the dynamics of zoonotic infectious diseases, John has previously used spatial interaction models to understand and predict the spread of White-nose syndrome in the North America, the 2013-2015 West African Ebola epidemic, SARS-CoV-2 across the United States in 2020, and COVID-19 importation risk into United States port of entry airports.  His research additionally seeds to understand how zoonotic Infectious Disease Intelligence can be used to inform leaders when an outbreak is beggingging, and how it may spread.
      <span class="read-more-target">
      As the PIPP Grant Phase I Principal Investigator (PI), John is leading a team of five scientists who are associated with the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, and several colleges and schools at the University of Georgia.

John holds a PhD in Biological Sciences from Notre Dame University.
