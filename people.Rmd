<h2>Justin Bahl</h2>

<p>
      Justin Bahl is an Associate Professor at the University of Georgia with appointments in the College of Public Health,       College of Veterinary Medicine, and Institute of Bioinformatics.  
      Having completed a B.S. with Honors at the University of Toronto, he pursued a PhD in Molecular Systematics and            Evolution at the University of Hong Kong.  With Hong Kong as the epicenter of the 2003 SARS-CoV global epidemic,           Justin changed his research focus to ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.</p>

<p class="toggle-text" style="display: none;">
    After completing his PhD, he joined the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases as a postdoctoral fellow and researched viral ecology and evolution. The State Key Laboratory is a World Health Organization (WHO) reference laboratory for the diagnosis of influenza A/H5 and is part of the NIAID Centers for Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance. He later moved to Singapore to continue his postdoctoral training in Molecular Epidemiology at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School and was promoted to Assistant Professor. He later joined the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston as an Associate Professor before relocating to the University of Georgia. 
    His training in evolutionary biology, epidemiology and ecology has equipped him for a research career focused on infectious disease dynamics.

Bogdan has earned an international reputation for modeling the dynamics of an exceptionally broad range of complex, nonlinear systems. His work is notable in its real-world impact on aerospace, ground transportation and energy, as well as biologic and ecologic systems. Many of Bogdan’s algorithms and models of the dynamics of airplane engine components have been implemented into manufacturing processes by long standing industry partners, enabling next-generation turbo-jet engines for both military and commercial aircraft. The methods he developed to use vibration to assess the health of lithium-ion battery packs have led to new design approaches to prolong battery life in hybrid electric vehicles. His work elucidating how structures interact with complex materials has led to new approaches to building foundations for offshore wind turbines. He has published over 350 articles in journals, conferences, and books.He received his Ph.D. from Duke University in 1999.
