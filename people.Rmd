<div class="toggle-text" style="display: none;">
Bahl holds a PhD in Molecular Systematics and Evolution from the University of Hong Kong.  
With Hong Kong as the epicenter of the 2003 SARS-CoV global epidemic, Bahl changed his research focus to ecology and evolution of infectious diseases.

After completing his PhD, Bahl joined the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases as a postdoctoral fellow and researching viral ecology and evolution. The State Key Laboratory is a World Health Organization (WHO) reference laboratory for the diagnosis of influenza A/H5, and a NIAID Center for Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance. 

He later joined Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore, first as a postdoctoral associate in Molecular Epidemiology, then as Assistant Professor, then moved to the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston as an Associate Professor before joining the University of Georgia. Bahl's training in evolutionary biology, epidemiology and ecology has equipped him for a research career focused on infectious disease dynamics.
