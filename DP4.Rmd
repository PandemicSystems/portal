## Abstract

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"', fig.cap=''}

```
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how the decisions of individuals regarding vaccination and mask-wearing were highly politicized and influenced by the messaging of visible spokespersons. This project focuses on developing a transmission model to classify individuals as either compliant or non-compliant with policies such as shelter-in-place, mask-wearing, or vaccination to explore long-term dynamics and identify “social tipping points” in infectious disease transmission. 

"Social tipping points" are conditions under which a combination of interventions, including public messaging, may lead to either rapid containment or a major outbreak. This model assumes that individuals are either Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), or Recovered and immune (R)  to illness. This model also considers a variable determining the severity of the policy. For example, lockdowns are more severe than gathering bans which are more severe than mask-wearing mandates.
