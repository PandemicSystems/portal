## The Pandemic Systems Group

The **Pandemic Systems Group** is a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional research group established to advance the understanding of pandemics from a human systems perspective.

We develop infectious disease intelligence grounded in the study of interacting human systems, including epidemiological, evolutionary, environmental, social, political and economic systems. 

## Heterogeneous Model Integration for Infectious Disease Intelligence

**Heterogeneous Model Integration for Infectious Disease Intelligence (&nbsp;HeMI&nbsp;:&nbsp;IDI&nbsp;)**
is an interdisciplinary project seeking to apply the engineering System-of-Systems (SoS) concept to the grand challenge of integrating models across disciplines and scales. This project introduces a new paradigm (SoS) for infectious disease modeling. 

This project is funded by an **NSF Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention Phase I Development Grant (PIPP Phase I)**. Our Phase I activities will culminate in the development of a vision paper outlining the SoS approach to infectious disease model integration. Focusing on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 as study systems, we are conducting six interdisciplinary demonstration projects applying SoS thinking to problems at the intersections of biology, computer science, social science, and engineering.

During Phase I, we are engaging in workforce enhancement through the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates. Broader impacts of our project include the development of innovative and translational modeling approaches with relevance to various US mission agencies (e.g. USDA, EPA, NIH, and CDC) and global organizations (e.g. WHO, FAO, OIE, UN), as well as the creation of extensible, open-access computer code and data pipelines for integrative infectious disease modeling.

<!-- We are currently forming an advisory board of leaders from academic, industry, government and non-governmental sectors, and building a network of stakeholders in advance of Phase II. -->
